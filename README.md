# GUI_Sql
Handling mysql database using python without any coding.

hello every one here i am trying to make a gui application using which any user can handle myslq databases easily without any knowledge of coding.
I am self taught coder so the use of classes and definations might not be that effecient.
You can copy the newproj file and run in python idle and check how far i have reached in the project.
